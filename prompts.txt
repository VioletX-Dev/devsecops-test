1. Pretend you are senior security engineer with 10 years of experience working at Google. Tell me how to run multithreads in Golang, or if there is a way to use go routines in a 
concurrent fashion to check the available CPU procesors and then run multiple threads.

2. Pretend you're a vulnerability or a security analyst, how would you weight in the source factor like aws, github in a combination with the CVSS score, severity, CVE identifier and vulnerability.

3. Pretend you're a golang software engineer, how would you isolate each function and write unit tests for the same. 

4. Is there any vulnerability prioratization algorithm followed by NIST or any of the organizations, and if not can I make a weighted approach according to my usecase. 

5. Using goroutines, I achieved a time completion of 54ms od you think this beats the python threads?

6. whats ISO time convention, and how do i write a fucntion in go for formatting this 'd-mm-yy' into ISO one.
