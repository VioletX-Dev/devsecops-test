    "title": "Misuse of ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback may cause authorization bypass in golang.org/x/crypto",
    "description": "Applications and libraries which misuse the ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback callback may be susceptible to an authorization bypass.\n\nThe documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions.\n\nFor example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key.\n\nSince this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/crypto@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth.\n\nUsers should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.",

This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.",

The group contains a list of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially evaluated until a match is found.  One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their key usage.

An unsuspecting user could still be affected by the issue reported in CVE-2022-24765, for example when navigating as root into a shared tmp directory that is owned by them, but where an attacker could create a git repository. Versions 2.37.1, 2.36.2, 2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5 contain a patch for this issue. The simplest way to avoid being affected by the exploit described in the example is to avoid running git as root (or an Administrator in Windows), and if needed to reduce its use to a minimum. While a generic workaround is not possible, a system could be hardened from the exploit described in the example by removing any such repository if it exists already and creating one as root to block any future attacks.",

The attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot of time/resources resolving records under a malicious delegation point where a considerable number of unresponsive NS records reside. It can trigger high CPU usage in some resolver implementations that continually look in the cache for resolved NS records in that delegation. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in orchestrated attacks. Unbound does not suffer from high CPU usage, but resources are still needed for resolving the malicious delegation. Unbound will keep trying to resolve the record until hard limits are reached. Based on the nature of the attack and the replies, different limits could be reached. From version 1.16.3 on, Unbound introduces fixes for better performance when under load, by cutting opportunistic queries for nameserver discovery and DNSKEY prefetching and limiting the number of times a delegation point can issue a cache lookup for missing records.",

Based on the nature of the attack and the replies, different limits could be reached. From version 1.16.3 on, Unbound introduces fixes for better performance when under load, by cutting opportunistic queries for nameserver discovery and DNSKEY prefetching and limiting the number of times a delegation point can issue a cache lookup for missing records.",

The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters.

In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed.

This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.

These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable.

If the function succeeds then the \"name_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.  The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.  These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0.  The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.",

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly affected as well.",

    "title": "ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit.

This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks.

For example, `/:a-:b`.\n\n### Patches\n\nFor users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`.\n\nThese versions add backtrack protection when a custom regex pattern is not provided:\n\n- [0.1.10](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.10)\n- [1.9.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0)\n- [3.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0)\n- [6.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0)\n\nThey do not protect against vulnerable user supplied capture groups. Protecting against explicit user patterns is out of scope for old versions and not considered a vulnerability.\n\nVersion [7.1.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.\n\nVersion [8.0.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v8.0.0) removes the features that can cause a ReDoS.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAll versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.\n\nIf paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.\n\n### Details\n\nUsing `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\\/([^\\/]+?)-([^\\/]+?)\\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.\n\nBecause JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n* [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)",

    "title": "path-to-regexp outputs backtracking regular expressions",
    "description": "### Impact\n\nA bad regular expression is generated any time you have two parameters within a single segment, separated by something that is not a period (`.`). For example, `/:a-:b`.\n\n### Patches\n\nFor users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`.\n\nThese versions add backtrack protection when a custom regex pattern is not provided:\n\n- [0.1.10](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.10)\n- [1.9.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0)\n- [3.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0)\n- [6.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0)\n\nThey do not protect against vulnerable user supplied capture groups. Protecting against explicit user patterns is out of scope for old versions and not considered a vulnerability.\n\nVersion [7.1.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.\n\nVersion [8.0.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v8.0.0) removes the features that can cause a ReDoS.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAll versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.\n\nIf paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.\n\n### Details\n\nUsing `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\\/([^\\/]+?)-([^\\/]+?)\\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.\n\nBecause JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n* [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)",

    "title": "DOM Clobbering Gadget found in rollup bundled scripts that leads to XSS",
    "description": "### Summary\n\nWe discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in rollup when bundling scripts that use `import.meta.url` or with plugins that emit and reference asset files from code  in `cjs`/`umd`/`iife` format. The DOM Clobbering gadget can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.\n\nIt's worth noting that we’ve identifed similar issues in other popular bundlers like Webpack ([CVE-2024-43788](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986)), which might serve as a good reference.\n\n### Details\n\n#### Backgrounds\n\nDOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:\n\n[1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf\n[2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/\n\n#### Gadget found in `rollup`\n\nWe have identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in `rollup` bundled scripts, particularly when the scripts uses `import.meta` and set output in format of  `cjs`/`umd`/`iife`. In such cases, `rollup` replaces meta property with the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`.\n\nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/b86ffd776cfa906573d36c3f019316d02445d9ef/src/ast/nodes/MetaProperty.ts#L157-L162\n\nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/b86ffd776cfa906573d36c3f019316d02445d9ef/src/ast/nodes/MetaProperty.ts#L180-L185\n\nHowever, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser's named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element (e.g., an `img` tag ) is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server.\n\n### PoC\n\nConsidering a website that contains the following `main.js` script, the devloper decides to use the `rollup` to bundle up the program: `rollup main.js --format cjs --file bundle.js`.\n\n```\nvar s = document.createElement('script')\ns.src = import.meta.url + 'extra.js'\ndocument.head.append(s)\n```\n\nThe output `bundle.js` is shown in the following code snippet.\n\n```\n'use strict';\n\nvar _documentCurrentScript = typeof document !== 'undefined' ? document.currentScript : null;\nvar s = document.createElement('script');\ns.src = (typeof document === 'undefined' ? require('u' + 'rl').pathToFileURL(__filename).href : (_documentCurrentScript \u0026\u0026 False \u0026\u0026 _documentCurrentScript.src || new URL('bundle.js', document.baseURI).href)) + 'extra.js';\ndocument.head.append(s);\n```\n\nAdding the `rollup` bundled script, `bundle.js`, as part of the web page source code, the page could load the `extra.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server` due to the introduced gadget during bundling. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the name attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.\n\n```\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\n  \u003ctitle\u003erollup Example\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!\u003e\n  \u003cimg name=\"currentScript\" src=\"https://attacker.controlled.server/\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\n  \u003c!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cscript type=\"module\" crossorigin src=\"bundle.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include rollup-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd` and use `import.meta`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the `name` or `id` attributes.\n\n### Patch\n\nPatching the following two functions with type checking would be effective mitigations against DOM Clobbering attack.\n\n```\nconst getRelativeUrlFromDocument = (relativePath: string, umd = false) =\u003e\n\tgetResolveUrl(\n\t\t`'${escapeId(relativePath)}', ${\n\t\t\tumd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''\n\t\t}document.currentScript \u0026\u0026 document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' \u0026\u0026 document.currentScript.src || document.baseURI`\n\t);\n```\n\n```\nconst getUrlFromDocument = (chunkId: string, umd = false) =\u003e\n\t`${\n\t\tumd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''\n\t}(${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT} \u0026\u0026 ${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' \u0026\u0026${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.src || new URL('${escapeId(\n\t\tchunkId\n\t)}', document.baseURI).href)`;\n```",

This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.\n\n```\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\n  \u003ctitle\u003erollup Example\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003c!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!\u003e\n  \u003cimg name=\"currentScript\" src=\"https://attacker.controlled.server/\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\n  \u003c!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cscript type=\"module\" crossorigin src=\"bundle.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include rollup-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd` and use `import.meta`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the `name` or `id` attributes.\n\n### Patch\n\nPatching the following two functions with type checking would be effective mitigations against DOM Clobbering attack.\n\n```\nconst getRelativeUrlFromDocument = (relativePath: string, umd = false) =\u003e\n\tgetResolveUrl(\n\t\t`'${escapeId(relativePath)}', ${\n\t\t\tumd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''\n\t\t}document.currentScript \u0026\u0026 document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' \u0026\u0026 document.currentScript.src || document.baseURI`\n\t);\n```\n\n```\nconst getUrlFromDocument = (chunkId: string, umd = false) =\u003e\n\t`${\n\t\tumd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''\n\t}(${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT} \u0026\u0026 ${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' \u0026\u0026${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.src || new URL('${escapeId(\n\t\tchunkId\n\t)}', document.baseURI).href)`;\n```",

However, the aufs patchs change mmap_region() to replace the fput() using a local variable with vma_fput(), which will fput() vm_file, leading to a refcount underflow.",

Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.  An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers - most of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by periods.  When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the sub-identifiers in bytes (*).  With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names / identifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms.  Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or decrypt, or digest passed data.

It also impacts anything that processes X.509 certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.  The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client authentication.  In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects, such as X.509 certificates.

After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.",

    "title": "Websites were able to send any requests to the development server and read the response in vite",
    "description": "### Summary\nVite allowed any websites to send any requests to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings and lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections.\n\n\u003e [!WARNING]\n\u003e This vulnerability even applies to users that only run the Vite dev server on the local machine.\n\n### Upgrade Path\nUsers that does not match either of the following conditions should be able to upgrade to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability without any additional configuration.\n\n- Using the backend integration feature\n- Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite\n- Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`\n- Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser\n\n#### Using the backend integration feature\nIf you are using the backend integration feature and not setting [`server.origin`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-origin), you need to add the origin of the backend server to the [`server.cors.origin`](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) option. Make sure to set a specific origin rather than `*`, otherwise any origin can access your development server.\n\n#### Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite\nIf you are using a reverse proxy in front of Vite and sending requests to Vite with a hostname other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`, you need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if the reverse proxy is sending requests to `http://vite:5173`, you need to add `vite` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.\n\n#### Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`\nYou need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if you are accessing the development server via `http://foo.example.com:8080`, you need to add `foo.example.com` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.\n\n#### Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser\nIf you are using a plugin / framework, try upgrading to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability. If the WebSocket connection appears not to be working, the plugin / framework may have a code that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser.\n\nIn that case, you can either:\n\n- fix the plugin / framework code to the make it compatible with the new version of Vite\n- set `legacy.skipWebSocketTokenCheck: true` to opt-out the fix for [2] while the plugin / framework is incompatible with the new version of Vite\n  - When enabling this option, **make sure that you are aware of the security implications** described in the impact section of [2] above.\n\n### Mitigation without upgrading Vite\n#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings\nSet `server.cors` to `false` or limit `server.cors.origin` to trusted origins.\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\nThere aren't any mitigations for this.\n\n#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests\nUse Chrome 94+ or use HTTPS for the development server.\n\n### Details\n\nThere are three causes that allowed malicious websites to send any requests to the development server:\n\n#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings\n\nVite sets the [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) header depending on [`server.cors`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-cors) option. The default value was `true` which sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. This allows websites on any origin to `fetch` contents served on the development server.\n\nAttack scenario:\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n2. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n3. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n4. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js`.\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\n\nVite starts a WebSocket server to handle HMR and other functionalities. This WebSocket server [did not perform validation on the Origin header](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v6.0.7/packages/vite/src/node/server/ws.ts#L145-L157) and was vulnerable to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attacks. With that attack, an attacker can read and write messages on the WebSocket connection. Vite only sends some information over the WebSocket connection ([list of the file paths that changed, the file content where the errored happened, etc.](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v6.0.7/packages/vite/types/hmrPayload.d.ts#L12-L72)), but plugins can send arbitrary messages and may include more sensitive information.\n\nAttack scenario:\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n2. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n3. The attacker runs `new WebSocket('http://127.0.0.1:5173', 'vite-hmr')` by JS in that malicious web page.\n4. The user edits some files.\n5. Vite sends some HMR messages over WebSocket.\n6. The attacker gets the content of the HMR messages.\n\n#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests\n\nUnless [`server.https`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-https) is set, Vite starts the development server on HTTP. Non-HTTPS servers are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks without validation on the Host header. But Vite did not perform validation on the Host header. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can send arbitrary requests to the development server bypassing the same-origin policy.\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page that is served on **HTTP** (`http://malicious.example.com:5173`) (HTTPS won't work).\n2. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n3. The attacker changes the DNS to point to 127.0.0.1 (or other private addresses).\n4. The attacker sends a `fetch('/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page.\n5. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js` bypassing the same origin policy.\n\n### Impact\n#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings\nUsers with the default `server.cors` option may:\n\n- get the source code stolen by malicious websites\n- give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally\n  - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities.\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\nAll users may get the file paths of the files that changed and the file content where the error happened be stolen by malicious websites.\n\nFor users that is using a plugin that sends messages over WebSocket, that content may be stolen by malicious websites.\n\nFor users that is using a plugin that has a functionality that is triggered by messages over WebSocket, that functionality may be exploited by malicious websites.\n\n#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests\nUsers using HTTP for the development server and using a browser that is not Chrome 94+ may:\n\n- get the source code stolen by malicious websites\n- give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally\n  - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities.\n\nChrome 94+ users are not affected for [3], because [sending a request to a private network page from public non-HTTPS page is forbidden](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/private-network-access-update#chrome_94) since Chrome 94.\n\n### Related Information\nSafari has [a bug that blocks requests to loopback addresses from HTTPS origins](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171934). This means when the user is using Safari and Vite is listening on lookback addresses, there's another condition of \"the malicious web page is served on HTTP\" to make [1] and [2] to work.\n\n### PoC\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\n1. I used the `react` template which utilizes HMR functionality.\n\n```\nnpm create vite@latest my-vue-app-react -- --template react\n```\n\n2. Then on a malicious server, serve the following POC html:\n```html\n\u003c!doctype html\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n    \u003chead\u003e\n        \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" /\u003e\n        \u003ctitle\u003evite CSWSH\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003c/head\u003e\n    \u003cbody\u003e\n        \u003cdiv id=\"logs\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cscript\u003e\n            const div = document.querySelectorAll('#logs')[0];\n            const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5173','vite-hmr');\n            ws.onmessage = event =\u003e {\n                const logLine = document.createElement('p');\n                logLine.innerHTML = event.data;\n                div.append(logLine);\n            };\n        \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n3. Kick off Vite \n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n4. Load the development server (open `http://localhost:5173/`) as well as the malicious page in the browser. \n5. Edit `src/App.jsx` file and intentionally place a syntax error\n6. Notice how the malicious page can view the websocket messages and a snippet of the source code is exposed\n\nHere's a video demonstrating the POC:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4ad05cd-0b34-461c-9ff6-d7c8663d6961",

    "description": "### Summary\nVite allowed any websites to send any requests to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings and lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections.\n\n\u003e [!WARNING]\n\u003e This vulnerability even applies to users that only run the Vite dev server on the local machine.\n\n### Upgrade Path\nUsers that does not match either of the following conditions should be able to upgrade to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability without any additional configuration.\n\n- Using the backend integration feature\n- Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite\n- Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`\n- Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser\n\n#### Using the backend integration feature\nIf you are using the backend integration feature and not setting [`server.origin`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-origin), you need to add the origin of the backend server to the [`server.cors.origin`](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) option. Make sure to set a specific origin rather than `*`, otherwise any origin can access your development server.\n\n#### Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite\nIf you are using a reverse proxy in front of Vite and sending requests to Vite with a hostname other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`, you need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if the reverse proxy is sending requests to `http://vite:5173`, you need to add `vite` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.\n\n#### Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`\nYou need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if you are accessing the development server via `http://foo.example.com:8080`, you need to add `foo.example.com` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.\n\n#### Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser\nIf you are using a plugin / framework, try upgrading to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability. If the WebSocket connection appears not to be working, the plugin / framework may have a code that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser.\n\nIn that case, you can either:\n\n- fix the plugin / framework code to the make it compatible with the new version of Vite\n- set `legacy.skipWebSocketTokenCheck: true` to opt-out the fix for [2] while the plugin / framework is incompatible with the new version of Vite\n  - When enabling this option, **make sure that you are aware of the security implications** described in the impact section of [2] above.\n\n### Mitigation without upgrading Vite\n#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings\nSet `server.cors` to `false` or limit `server.cors.origin` to trusted origins.\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\nThere aren't any mitigations for this.\n\n#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests\nUse Chrome 94+ or use HTTPS for the development server.\n\n### Details\n\nThere are three causes that allowed malicious websites to send any requests to the development server:\n\n#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings\n\nVite sets the [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) header depending on [`server.cors`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-cors) option. The default value was `true` which sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. This allows websites on any origin to `fetch` contents served on the development server.\n\nAttack scenario:\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n2. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n3. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n4. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js`.\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\n\nVite starts a WebSocket server to handle HMR and other functionalities. This WebSocket server [did not perform validation on the Origin header](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v6.0.7/packages/vite/src/node/server/ws.ts#L145-L157) and was vulnerable to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attacks. With that attack, an attacker can read and write messages on the WebSocket connection. Vite only sends some information over the WebSocket connection ([list of the file paths that changed, the file content where the errored happened, etc.](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v6.0.7/packages/vite/types/hmrPayload.d.ts#L12-L72)), but plugins can send arbitrary messages and may include more sensitive information.\n\nAttack scenario:\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n2. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n3. The attacker runs `new WebSocket('http://127.0.0.1:5173', 'vite-hmr')` by JS in that malicious web page.\n4. The user edits some files.\n5. Vite sends some HMR messages over WebSocket.\n6. The attacker gets the content of the HMR messages.\n\n#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests\n\nUnless [`server.https`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-https) is set, Vite starts the development server on HTTP. Non-HTTPS servers are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks without validation on the Host header. But Vite did not perform validation on the Host header. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can send arbitrary requests to the development server bypassing the same-origin policy.\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page that is served on **HTTP** (`http://malicious.example.com:5173`) (HTTPS won't work).\n2. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n3. The attacker changes the DNS to point to 127.0.0.1 (or other private addresses).\n4. The attacker sends a `fetch('/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page.\n5. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js` bypassing the same origin policy.\n\n### Impact\n#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings\nUsers with the default `server.cors` option may:\n\n- get the source code stolen by malicious websites\n- give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally\n  - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities.\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\nAll users may get the file paths of the files that changed and the file content where the error happened be stolen by malicious websites.\n\nFor users that is using a plugin that sends messages over WebSocket, that content may be stolen by malicious websites.\n\nFor users that is using a plugin that has a functionality that is triggered by messages over WebSocket, that functionality may be exploited by malicious websites.\n\n#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests\nUsers using HTTP for the development server and using a browser that is not Chrome 94+ may:\n\n- get the source code stolen by malicious websites\n- give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally\n  - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities.\n\nChrome 94+ users are not affected for [3], because [sending a request to a private network page from public non-HTTPS page is forbidden](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/private-network-access-update#chrome_94) since Chrome 94.\n\n### Related Information\nSafari has [a bug that blocks requests to loopback addresses from HTTPS origins](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171934). This means when the user is using Safari and Vite is listening on lookback addresses, there's another condition of \"the malicious web page is served on HTTP\" to make [1] and [2] to work.\n\n### PoC\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\n1. I used the `react` template which utilizes HMR functionality.\n\n```\nnpm create vite@latest my-vue-app-react -- --template react\n```\n\n2. Then on a malicious server, serve the following POC html:\n```html\n\u003c!doctype html\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n    \u003chead\u003e\n        \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" /\u003e\n        \u003ctitle\u003evite CSWSH\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003c/head\u003e\n    \u003cbody\u003e\n        \u003cdiv id=\"logs\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cscript\u003e\n            const div = document.querySelectorAll('#logs')[0];\n            const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5173','vite-hmr');\n            ws.onmessage = event =\u003e {\n                const logLine = document.createElement('p');\n                logLine.innerHTML = event.data;\n                div.append(logLine);\n            };\n        \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n3. Kick off Vite \n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n4. Load the development server (open `http://localhost:5173/`) as well as the malicious page in the browser. \n5. Edit `src/App.jsx` file and intentionally place a syntax error\n6. Notice how the malicious page can view the websocket messages and a snippet of the source code is exposed\n\nHere's a video demonstrating the POC:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4ad05cd-0b34-461c-9ff6-d7c8663d6961",

In such cases, Vite replaces relative paths starting with `__VITE_ASSET__` using the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`.\n\nHowever, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser's named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the src attribute of the attacker-controlled element is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server.\n\n```\nconst relativeUrlMechanisms = {\n  amd: (relativePath) =\u003e {\n    if (relativePath[0] !== \".\") relativePath = \"./\" + relativePath;\n    return getResolveUrl(\n      `require.toUrl('${escapeId(relativePath)}'), document.baseURI`\n    );\n  },\n  cjs: (relativePath) =\u003e `(typeof document === 'undefined' ? ${getFileUrlFromRelativePath(\n    relativePath\n  )} : ${getRelativeUrlFromDocument(relativePath)})`,\n  es: (relativePath) =\u003e getResolveUrl(\n    `'${escapeId(partialEncodeURIPath(relativePath))}', import.meta.url`\n  ),\n  iife: (relativePath) =\u003e getRelativeUrlFromDocument(relativePath),\n  // NOTE: make sure rollup generate `module` params\n  system: (relativePath) =\u003e getResolveUrl(\n    `'${escapeId(partialEncodeURIPath(relativePath))}', module.meta.url`\n  ),\n  umd: (relativePath) =\u003e `(typeof document === 'undefined' \u0026\u0026 typeof location === 'undefined' ? ${getFileUrlFromRelativePath(\n    relativePath\n  )} : ${getRelativeUrlFromDocument(relativePath, true)})`\n};\n```\n\n### PoC\n\nConsidering a website that contains the following `main.js` script, the devloper decides to use the Vite to bundle up the program with the following configuration. \n\n```\n// main.js\nimport extraURL from './extra.js?url'\nvar s = document.createElement('script')\ns.src = extraURL\ndocument.head.append(s)\n```\n\n```\n// extra.js\nexport default \"https://myserver/justAnOther.js\"\n```\n\n```\n// vite.config.js\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  build: {\n    assetsInlineLimit: 0, // To avoid inline assets for PoC\n    rollupOptions: {\n      output: {\n        format: \"cjs\"\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  base: \"./\",\n});\n```\n\nAfter running the build command, the developer will get following bundle as the output.\n\n```\n// dist/index-DDmIg9VD.js\n\"use strict\";const t=\"\"+(typeof document\u003e\"u\"?require(\"url\").pathToFileURL(__dirname+\"/extra-BLVEx9Lb.js\").href:new URL(\"extra-BLVEx9Lb.js\",document.currentScript\u0026\u0026document.currentScript.src||document.baseURI).href);var e=document.createElement(\"script\");e.src=t;document.head.append(e);\n```\n\nAdding the Vite bundled script, `dist/index-DDmIg9VD.js`, as part of the web page source code, the page could load the `extra.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server`. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the `name` attribute set to `currentScript`.

    "title": "Webpack's AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule has a DOM Clobbering Gadget that leads to XSS",
    "description": "### Summary\n\nWe discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.\n\nWe found the real-world exploitation of this gadget in the Canvas LMS which allows XSS attack happens through an javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). We believe this is a severe issue. If Webpack’s code is not resilient to DOM Clobbering attacks, it could lead to significant security vulnerabilities in any web application using Webpack-compiled code.\n\n\n### Details\n\n#### Backgrounds\n\nDOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:\n\n[1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf\n[2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/\n\n\n#### Gadgets found in Webpack\n\nWe identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`.

    "title": "Webpack's AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule has a DOM Clobbering Gadget that leads to XSS",
    "description": "### Summary\n\nWe discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.\n\nWe found the real-world exploitation of this gadget in the Canvas LMS which allows XSS attack happens through an javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). We believe this is a severe issue. If Webpack’s code is not resilient to DOM Clobbering attacks, it could lead to significant security vulnerabilities in any web application using Webpack-compiled code.\n\n\n### Details\n\n#### Backgrounds\n\nDOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:\n\n[1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf\n[2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/\n\n\n#### Gadgets found in Webpack\n\nWe identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. When the `output.publicPath` field in the configuration is not set or is set to `auto`, the following code is generated in the bundle to dynamically resolve and load additional JavaScript files:\n\n```\n/******/ \t/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */\n/******/ \t(() =\u003e {\n/******/ \t\tvar scriptUrl;\n/******/ \t\tif (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + \"\";\n/******/ \t\tvar document = __webpack_require__.g.document;\n/******/ \t\tif (!scriptUrl \u0026\u0026 document) {\n/******/ \t\t\tif (document.currentScript)\n/******/ \t\t\t\tscriptUrl = document.currentScript.src;\n/******/ \t\t\tif (!scriptUrl) {\n/******/ \t\t\t\tvar scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\");\n/******/ \t\t\t\tif(scripts.length) {\n/******/ \t\t\t\t\tvar i = scripts.length - 1;\n/******/ \t\t\t\t\twhile (i \u003e -1 \u0026\u0026 (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src;\n/******/ \t\t\t\t}\n/******/ \t\t\t}\n/******/ \t\t}\n/******/ \t\t// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration\n/******/ \t\t// or pass an empty string (\"\") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic.\n/******/ \t\tif (!scriptUrl) throw new Error(\"Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser\");\n/******/ \t\tscriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, \"\").replace(/\\?.*$/, \"\").replace(/\\/[^\\/]+$/, \"/\");\n/******/ \t\t__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl;\n/******/ \t})();\n```\n\nHowever, this code is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The lookup on the line with `document.currentScript` can be shadowed by an attacker, causing it to return an attacker-controlled HTML element instead of the current script element as intended.

Though Git will abort local clones whose source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic links, the `objects` directory itself may still be a symbolic link. These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as CVE-2022-39253.  A fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8. If upgrading is impractical, two short-term workarounds are available.

    "description": "Git is a revision control system. Using a specially-crafted repository, Git prior to versions 2.39.2, 2.38.4, 2.37.6, 2.36.5, 2.35.7, 2.34.7, 2.33.7, 2.32.6, 2.31.7, and 2.30.8 can be tricked into using its local clone optimization even when using a non-local transport. Though Git will abort local clones whose source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic links, the `objects` directory itself may still be a symbolic link. These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as CVE-2022-39253.  A fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8. If upgrading is impractical, two short-term workarounds are available.

The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persisted prior to https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/pull/266.

    "title": "Bad documentation of error handling in ParseWithClaims can lead to potentially dangerous situations",
    "description": "### Summary\n\nUnclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens.\n\n### Fix\n\nWe have back-ported the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release.\n\n### Workaround \n\nWe are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (\"dangerous\" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.\n\n```Go\ntoken, err := /* jwt.Parse or similar */\nif token.Valid {\n\tfmt.Println(\"You look nice today\")\n} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenMalformed) {\n\tfmt.Println(\"That's not even a token\")\n} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenUnverifiable) {\n\tfmt.Println(\"We could not verify this token\")\n} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid) {\n\tfmt.Println(\"This token has an invalid signature\")\n} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenExpired) || errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenNotValidYet) {\n\t// Token is either expired or not active yet\n\tfmt.Println(\"Timing is everything\")\n} else {\n\tfmt.Println(\"Couldn't handle this token:\", err)\n}\n```",

    "title": "Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer.  Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation unlikely.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they become available.",

    "title": "Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature verification.

    "description": "Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit the modulus size when performing the checks. An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.
